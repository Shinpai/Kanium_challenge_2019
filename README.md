A game development challenge to learn to use Unity
---
### RULES:
> 1. Unity version 2018.3.2f1. (Unity hub recommended)

> 2. Developed game must be based on this repo. So clone and build stuff on top of this.

> 3. Try to not share what you are doing, support is hopefully available for tech issues.

> 4. No premade assets. Draw stick figures with paint. Copying code and stuff from other projects is cool.

> 5. Time limit is 48h (a weekend basically)

> 6. Must share end result, whatever it is.
