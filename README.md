# Kanium_challenge_2019
A gamejam sort of development challenge/workshop to learn to use Unity. Maybe just use it for motivation to get started with unity.
---

### Instructions

> 1. Download unity OR unity hub(recommended) [from here](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download)

Some older docs for unity hub [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10Z9lsSVKfrr4agsquOlUs5s1wlfK7Kng95hLQovGDfk/edit), should still apply except its easier now.

> 1.1 Install a unity version through hub (just get a 2018.3.x, they are pretty compatible, current is 2018.3.12f)

> 2. Make a new project

> If you want to use version control (which is recommended and a good thing to learn as well), ask Noctem for Kanium github access to get started.

> 3. Think of the game you wish to make, then simplify it a hundred times over.
> 4. Make game

### RULES:
> 0. Your game must control using only ONE BUTTON! This includes such glorious events as: 
>> - press the button down
>> - hold the button
>> - release the button

> If you can, try to come up with mechanics or events that complement such simple control schema.

> 1. Try to not share what you are doing too much, more fun looking at other peoples stuff after. Tech issues and such aside of course. This challenge is for learning stuff together after all.

> 2. No premade assets, more fun this way and it doesnt matter what it looks like. Draw stick figures with paint or record screams with your mic. Copying code and stuff from other projects is cool as long as comment or present sources somewhere.

> 3. Time limit is 48h (a weekend basically). Time starts on posting this and ends on sunday night.

> 4. Must share end result, whatever it is. Again, does not matter if it is unfinished or very simple, everyone is doing different stuff at different levels and the point is to learn something.

> 5. MOST IMPORTANT RULE: try to learn something, have fun doing it.

### TIPS:

* A LOT of things can be done _either_ via code or just simply through the GUI. If you dont have coding experience, you can make a simple game with just the GUI interactions if you want.
* Use the official documentation, its very decent and comes with examples at the bottom.
* Try to look at small scale examples of what you are doing to help you in implementing it.
* Youtube is full of "how to do this thing in unity" videos.
* Ask me in discord (Shinpai) if you need help with anything.
